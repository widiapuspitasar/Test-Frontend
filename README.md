- **Script**:
The script uses Vue's Composition API and Pinia for state management. It includes computed properties for binding to the Pinia store state and a method to handle formatting and updating income.

- **CSS**:
The application uses Tailwind CSS for styling.

### Tax Calculation Logic
The tax calculation follows these rules:

1. If income is invalid, return "Invalid income".
2. If age is invalid, return "Invalid age".
3. If dependents is invalid, return "Invalid dependents".
4. If age is less than 18, return "Not eligible for tax".
5. If age is 65 or older, apply a 20% tax discount.
6. Tax brackets:

   - **Income â‰¤ $10,000**: 10% tax

   - **Income $10,001 - $50,000**: 20% tax

   - **Income > $50,000**: 30% tax

7. Deduct $500 for each dependent.
